/*
In the context of a Node.js application using the Express.js framework, `app.use(express.json())` is a middleware function. 

Middleware functions in Express.js have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 

`express.json()` is built-in middleware in Express.js that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads. When you call `app.use(express.json())`, you are telling your Express application to use this middleware for every incoming request. This middleware parses the JSON payload of the request and populates the `req.body` property with the parsed JSON data, making it accessible to your application's routes and handlers. This way, you can easily work with JSON data in your Express application.

//:id? means optinal parameter

//3. ROUTES

app.use('/api/v1/tours', tourRouter); //tourRouter is a middleware
app.use('/api/v1/users', userRouter);

//handling unhandler routes
app.all('*', (req, res, next) => {
  next(new AppError(`cant't find ${req.originalUrl} on this server!!`, 404));

  // err.status = 'fail';
  // err.statusCode = 404;
  // next(err);
});

app.use(globalErrorHandler);
